# Metoo Tweets Sentiment Analysis || WWCode Hackathon for Social Good 2023

## Introduction

In today’s world social media plays a crucial role in analyzing the impact of movements such as #MeToo on people and vice versa. Due to the immense reach of social media,there is a need to analyse and understand people’s reactions to determine the impact of the movement.

## Meet the Team

We are a team of passionate undergraduate students pursuing Btech in AIML from SIT - Pune, India.

## Problem Statement

The problem we aim to address is to conduct sentiment analysis on #MeToo movement twitter data to evaluate the reaction of the public towards the movement, and also to monitor the involvement of key individuals.

The project successfully helps to visualise emotions and sentiments attached with the movement on twitter as well as helps people understand the sentiment associated with public figures who are more frequently mentioned in the tweets.

We are working with Python libraries such as re, ntlk, spacy, LDA, plotly and matplotlib for data science, analytics and visualisation as well as AI & ML Models such as ,

## Plan of Action

Our plan of action involves a well-structured approach to tackle the analysis effectively. Here are the key steps we will follow:

1. **Analyzing Quantity**: To analyze Twitter data, determine the total number of unique tweets, examine the distribution of tweet timestamps, identify original tweets and retweets, count truncated tweets, and ascertain the number of original tweets or replies.

2. **Analyzing the Popularity of Tweets**: Explore tweets with the highest 'favoriteCount' and 'retweetCount,' identify tweets with high counts for both, analyze content and timing of popular tweets, and investigate influential users associated with high engagement.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Conduct sentiment analysis to categorize tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, analyze the sentiment of popular tweets, track sentiment changes over time, and examine sentiment in tweets directed at well-known individuals.

4. **Words and Phrases**: Discover the most popular words, trigrams, bigrams, and phrases associated with the movement, analyze their occurrence within different sentiment categories, identify trending hashtags beyond #MeToo, and investigate word co-occurrence patterns in the tweets.

5. **Understanding the different topics**: Perform topic modeling to uncover hidden themes in the tweets, analyze sentiment distribution within these topics, explore key terms in each topic, and identify influential figures within the topics.

## Our Goal

Our primary goal for this hackathon project is to gain better understanding of the #metoo movement and its impact on people as well as to pread awareness about Woman Empowerment, Safety and Crime Rates. Additionally, we aim to gain valuable experience, collaborate effectively as a team, and showcase our tech skills and creativity!

## Our Project

### Project Name

**Me Too Tweets Sentiment Analysis**

### Project Description
In this project we have primarily used Python libraries like , Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models such as , to analyse and visualise the emotions attached with the #metoo tweets and prominent public figures. This insight will greatly help in understanding the reach and impact of such movements that happen on social media platforms as well as help in spreading awareness about safety and empowerment of survivors of such crimes.

### Technologies Used

- Python libraries : re, ntlk, spacy, LDA (latent dilichlet allocation), plotly, matplotlib, seaborn and Vader
- AI and ML models: 
- Data analysis and visualisation tools: plotly, matplotlib, seaborn

### Results: 


### Future Improvements
We can add more dimension to this project by accessing the X (formerly Twitter) API and using realtime data to predict emotions and plot interactive graphs.
